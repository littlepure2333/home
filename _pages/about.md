I am currently a master student at [PRIS](http://www.pris.net.cn/) Lab, [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Chuang Zhang](http://www.pris.net.cn/introduction/teacher/zhangchuang). 

My research focuses on Computer Vision, espically interested on learning-based visual synthesis.

<font color=Red>Now I am actively finding a Ph.D. position, please contact me if you are interested. </font>
